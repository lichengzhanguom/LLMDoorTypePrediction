## Introduction
The repository is leveraging LLMs (here GPT-4.1) to predict door type after door detection in [our another repository](https://github.com/lichengzhanguom/Co-DETR/tree/own).
As a result, we generate a dataset of different door types as well as their locations with trivial manual labeling effort.

## Running
### Run Predict.py
```shell
python predict.py
```
